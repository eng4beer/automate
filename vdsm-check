#### This is a simple bash script to check vdsm and hosted engine
#### It will restart vdsm if there is an issue with hosted engine
#### It's not great and I am sure there is a better way to do it, but it does work
#!/bin/bash
echo `date` "Check script running " >> /var/log/vdsm-check
vdsm=$(/usr/sbin/hosted-engine --vm-status)
status=$(/usr/sbin/hosted-engine --vm-status |grep state |cut -d "=" -f2)
if [ "$vdsm" = 'The hosted engine configuration has not been retrieved from shared storage. Please ensure that ovirt-ha-agent is running and the storage server is reachable.' ]
    then
    /usr/bin/echo `date` 'Restarting vdsmd' >> /var/log/vdsm-check
    systemctl restart vdsmd
